# NLP Keyword Extraction

## Overview

This project focuses on extracting keywords from documents using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The primary goal is to evaluate different keyword extraction methods to enhance information retrieval and metadata generation. This project applies both statistical and graph-based approaches, including:

- **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**
- **Graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank, PositionRank, and more)**
- **Machine learning-based approaches like KeyBERT**


---

## Features

- **Multiple Keyword Extraction Techniques**: Includes TF-IDF, PageRank, PositionRank, and KeyBERT.
- **Benchmarking and Evaluation**: Uses datasets with manually annotated keywords for comparison.
- **Graph-Based NLP Methods**: Implements PageRank and PositionRank for keyword ranking.
- **Dynamic Thresholding**: Allows both fixed and dynamic quantile-based keyword selection.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates extracted keywords using Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR), and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG).
- **Dataset Support**: Preconfigured for **Inspec, DUC2001, and NUS** datasets.

## Evaluation Metrics
The project implements multiple evaluation metrics to assess the performance of keyword extraction algorithms:

- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**
- **MRR (Mean Reciprocal Rank)**
- **NDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain)**
